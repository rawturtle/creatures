#                         can query the state of the creatures by using some built-in methods as well as any methods
#                         you decide to add to MyCreature class.  The length of the list is the size of
#                         the population.  You need to generate a new population of the same size.  Creatures from
#                         old population can be used in the new population - simulation will reset them to starting
#                         state.
